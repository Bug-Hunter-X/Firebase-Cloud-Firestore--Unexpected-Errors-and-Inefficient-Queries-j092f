This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase Cloud Firestore: unexpected errors arising from inefficient queries or improper data handling.  The `firestoreBug.js` file shows an example of a poorly designed query that can lead to performance issues, and the solution in `firestoreBugSolution.js` demonstrates how to optimize the query for improved efficiency and error handling.  The example focuses on retrieving a large dataset in an efficient manner while also including comprehensive error handling.
