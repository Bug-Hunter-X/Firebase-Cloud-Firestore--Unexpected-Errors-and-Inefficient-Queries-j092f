In a Firebase project, when using Cloud Firestore, an unexpected error might occur due to improper data handling or inefficient query structures. For instance, attempting to retrieve a large dataset with a single query can lead to performance bottlenecks or timeout errors. Another potential issue arises from neglecting to handle potential errors during data transactions. This can result in crashes or data inconsistencies when an operation fails.
