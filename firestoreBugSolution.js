The solution involves optimizing the query to retrieve data in smaller batches, using pagination or limiting the number of documents retrieved. This prevents the application from being overwhelmed by a large dataset. Additionally, proper error handling using try...catch blocks is implemented to gracefully handle potential issues during data retrieval. The code also includes clear logging statements to help diagnose problems.
